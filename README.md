# mudflat

Minimal universal dependency friendly little automated tagger

A coding system supporting PLOVER (of course): https://github.com/openeventdata/PLOVER; http://ploverdata.org

`mudflat` is basically a testbed for the `FJOLTYNG` coder, which will be a full-featured PLOVER coder based on 
universal dependency parses. [`FJOLTYNG`](http://parusanalytics.com/fjoltyng/) will use a new set of JSON formats for both input and dictionaries,
which is to say it will not be compatible with the input files of either `mudflat` or the `TABARI/PETRARCH` family of coders.

----------
Main driver program

globals.py
-------------
Globals, adapted from PETRARCH-2 (https://github.com/openeventdata/petrarch2)

reader.py
------------
Configuration and dictionary input adapted from PETRARCH-2; CoNNL input

coder.py
---------------
Coding routines

utilities.py
---------------
Small utility routines, with parts adapted from PETRARCH-2

CAMEO2PLOVER.txt
---------------
PLOVER event-mode-context equivalents to CAMEO codes. Definitely a first approximation.

extract_UD_parse.py
-------------------
Utility program for experimenting with CoNLL-U format routines

mudflat_testdata_Mk1.txt
------------------------
Records used to achieve "first light": these are actual reports, with the CoNLL-U parse generated by Stanford CoreNLP;
actor and verb dictionaries are just the usual ones for PETRARCH-2

Documentation.md

Draft documentation, which is more a storage point for future elements of the documentation than a finished product
